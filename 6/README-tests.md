To run the test harness, xrun, go to folder 6 of Tsuro and run "python xrun.py < \<file with testing input>"

The file with testing input must have player specifications in the form \[{"name": <Player name\>, "strategy": <Player strategy\>},..]

The supported strategies are "dumb" and "less_dumb"

Players may have the same name, though it may make looking at logs confusing
